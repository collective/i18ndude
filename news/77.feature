Add boolean ``--no-line-numbers`` option to ``rebuild-pot``.
Use this to prevent including line numbers in pot files.
The default is to still include them, so no behavior change.
The default could change in the future.
If you want to be sure to keep your line numbers in the future, use the new ``--line-numbers`` option.
