'i18ndude rebuild-pot --exlude="name1 name2"` now also accepts
directory names for exclusion. This does not support wildcard globs
for directories, but it does support substring match if the exlusion
contains a / slash.

Excluding a directory name will exclude all files in and below the
given directory. You can either specify an exact directory name "bar"
(will match foo/bar/baz but not foobar/barbaz), or a path "foo/bar"
(will match foo/bar/baz and foo/barbaz) for exclusion.
